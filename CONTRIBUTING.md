# How to contribute to Concuerror

First of all, thank you for taking time to contribute to Concuerror!


## I want to ask a question.

Use the [mailing list][mailing list] and take a look at the [FAQ][faq] if you haven't already!


## I want to report a bug.

* Ensure that you can reproduce the bug on the [latest version of the `master` branch][latest].

* Take a moment to check whether the bug has already been reported by searching Github's [Issues][Issues]. If you find a relevant one, leave a comment there.

* If you cannot find an existing relevant Issue, [open a new bug Issue][open a new bug Issue].


## I want to write a patch that fixes a bug.

* Find/write at least one small test that fails without the patch.

* Fork Concuerror's repository and push a new branch for your patch, using a suitably descriptive name.

* Make sure to also commit the tests that need the patch. You can find out how test suites are organized in the README files of the [tests][tests] and [tests-real][tests-real] directories.

* Make a [Pull Request][pull request].


## I want to suggest a feature.

* **Take a moment to check whether a similar feature has already been requested** by searching Github's [Issues][Issues]. If you find a relevant Issue, leave a comment there.

* Apart from the main repository, take a look at the Issues page of the developer's own fork: [@aronisstav Issues][aronisstav Issues]

* If you cannot find an existing relevant Issue, [open a new feature Issue][open a new feature Issue].
