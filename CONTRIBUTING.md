# How to contribute to Concuerror

First of all, thank you for taking time to contribute to Concuerror!


## I just have a question!

Use the [mailing list][mailing list] and take a look at the [FAQ][faq] if you haven't already!


## Did you encounter a bug?

* **Ensure the bug has not already been reported** by searching Github's [Issues][Issues]. If you find a relevant issue, feel free to leave a new comment there.

* If you cannot find an existing relevant Issue, [open a new Issue][open a new Issue]. Include a **title** and a **description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.


## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Fork Concuerror's repository and push a new branch for your patch, using a good, descriptive name.

* Make sure to include at least one test that needs the fix (and fails otherwise).

* Open a Pull Request (PR) with the patch.

* Ensure the PR's description explains the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number, if applicable.


## Do you want to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* Take a look at the Issue pages of the developers' own forks for relevant ideas and leave comments there: [@aronisstav Issues][aronisstav Issues]

* Suggest your change in the [mailing list][mailing list] and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. The main repository's Issues are intended for bug reports and fixes.
